<h1>Verb Forms</h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Omission of Verb Particles</h2>
<p>Verb particles may be omitted at the speaker's discretion, or, if preferred, the speaker may apply the following
	guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>The dictionary form of the verb may express the simple present, allowing for the omission of the markers
			<strong>nun</strong>, <strong>du-</strong> and <strong>u</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In storytelling, as well, the dictionary verb form alone may be used to narrate events. Technically speaking,
			it's not that the simple past particle <strong>le</strong> is omitted in this case, but rather a story is
			told as if the scene of a film were being described, in the present tense, with the omission of
			<strong>nun</strong>, <strong>du-</strong> or <strong>u</strong>. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Other than in the cases described above, tense/mood may be established anew with every subject phrase and
			maintained without repetition for other verbs or until the tense/mood is changed within that clause. In
			other words, the particle for <em>any</em> tense/mood may be omitted in subsequent verbs within a clause
			once the tense/mood has been established with the first verb of each predicate. </p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dictionary Verb Form</h3>
<p>By default, the dictionary verb form expresses the general present tense, which is equivalent to the English simple
	present. In addition, the dictionary form alone may also express the present active tense, which is equivalent to
	the present progressive in English. In other words, the dictionary verb form alone is ambiguous and implies the
	omission of either <strong>nun</strong> or <strong>du-</strong>. </p>
<h3>The Particle u</h3>
<p>As an alternative to using the dictionary verb form alone, the particle <strong>u</strong> may be used in place of
	either <strong>nun</strong> or <strong>du-</strong>. This particle is typically only used in formal texts or speech
	as a simple way to mark the predicate where no other tense/mood marker is being used.</p>
<h3>Prefix du-</h3>
<p>As a verb prefix, <strong>du-</strong> expresses the continuous/habitual aspect, which depicts an activity or a state
	over an indefinite period of time, rather than happening in a single moment in time or for a specific length of
	time. The prefix <strong>du-</strong> is typically omitted with the present tense.</p>
<p>As nouns, words with the prefix <strong>du-</strong> are equivalent to the gerund in English.</p>
<p><strong>dulala</strong> - (the act of) singing<br>
	<strong>dudanse</strong> - (the act of) dancing
</p>
<p><em>The prefix <strong>du-</strong> is truncated from <strong>dure</strong> (duration).<br> Etymology of
		<strong>dure</strong>: English, French, German, Spanish</em></p>
<h2>Simple Past</h2>
<p>The simple past tenses are expressed using the particle <strong>le</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Etymology of <strong>le</strong>: Mandarin (了 “le”), Swahili (-li-), Russian (-л “-l”)</em></p>

			<td><strong>jaxa</strong><br><br></td>
			<td><strong>Mi jaxa yam pingo.</strong><br>I am about to eat the apple.</td>

<h3>Prefix ja-</h3>
<p>The prefix <strong>ja-</strong> means <em>immediately adjacent</em> and is truncated from <strong>jara</strong>
	(<em>neighbor</em>).</p>
<p><em>Etymology of <strong>jara</strong>: Arabic (جارة “jara”), Swahili (jirani), Indonesia (jiran)</em></p>
<h2>Compound Tenses</h2>
<p>The compound tenses are formed by combining any two of the general tense particles (<strong>nun</strong>,
	<strong>le</strong>, <strong>xa</strong>).</p>
<p>Linguistically speaking, the compound tenses are used for expressing different grammatical aspects in detail. There
	are three aspects expressed through the compound tenses, which correlate with the three rows in each of the tables
	below: progressive (active), perfective (completed) and prospective.</p>
<p>While the simple tenses report events only from the point of view of the present moment, the compound tenses are used
	for reporting the temporal status and aspect of an event from the point of view of the present, past or future.</p>
<p>Some compound tenses are rarely used and are often best expressed using a simple tense instead. Others are more
	useful and may be rather common in speech, particularly the following tenses: past active (<strong>le nun</strong>),
	present completed (<strong>nun le</strong>), future completed (<strong>xa le</strong>), past prospective (<strong>le
		xa</strong>).</p>
<h2>Compound Present Tenses</h2>

<p>It is worth noting that whereas the <em>perfect</em> tenses in English do not always express a completed action, the
	<em>completed</em> tenses in Globasa always do.</p>
<h2>Continuative Aspect</h2>
<p>The <em>continuative aspect</em> adverb <strong>dupul</strong> is used when an action or state began in the past and
	continues into the present. In English, this is expressed either with the <em>present perfect</em> or the
	<em>perfect progressive</em>.</p>
<h3>Example Sentences with the Present Perfect in English</h3>
<p><strong>Mi no dupul oko te xorfe mesi tiga.</strong><br> I haven't seen her since March.</p>
<p><strong>Mi dupul kone te dur 30 nyan.</strong><br> I have known him for 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>Mi dupul sen gadibu.</strong><br> I have been angry.</p>
<p><strong>Yu dupul sen kepul?</strong><br> How have you been?</p>
<h3>Example Sentences with the Perfect Progressive in English</h3>
<p><strong>Mi dupul yam hin pingo dur un satu.</strong><br> I have been eating this apple for one hour.</p>
<p><strong>Yu dupul fale keto?</strong><br> What have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>Mi dupul doxo hin kitabu xorfe jaleli sabedin.</strong><br> I have been reading this book since last week.
</p>
<h2>Conditional Mood</h2>
<p>The conditional mood is expressed using the particle <strong>ger</strong>. </p>
<p><em>The particle <strong>ger</strong> is truncated from <strong>eger</strong> (if).<br> Etymology of
		<strong>eger</strong>: Hindi (अगर “agar”), Persian (اگر “agar”), Turkish (eğer)</em></p>

			<td><strong>Mi ger le yam pingo.</strong><br>I would have eaten the apple.</td>

	</tbody>
</table>
<p>The subordinate clause (if...) uses the dictionary form of the verb.</p>
<p><strong>Mi ger yam pingo eger mi sen yamkal.</strong><br> I would eat the apple if I were hungry.</p>
<h2>Passive Voice <a id="be-"></a></h2>
<p>The passive voice is expressed using the prefix <strong>be-</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Etymology of <strong>be-</strong>: Mandarin (被 “bèi”), English (be), Norwegian (ble)</em></p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Passive Voice</th>

			<td>Future Passive<br><br></td>
			<td><strong>xa be-</strong><br><br></td>
			<td><strong>Pingo xa beyam mi.</strong><br>The apple will be eaten by me.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although the passive mood can technically also be used with all the compound tenses, in practice it is most often
	used with the general present, past and future tenses, as illustrated above.</p>
<p>Note: In Globasa, the agent in passive voice sentences is expressed as the direct object without the need for a
	preposition to mark the agent. In contrast, English marks the agent using <em>by</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Myaw le no velosi yam piu.</strong><br> The cat didn't eat the bird quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Piu le no velosi beyam myaw.</strong><br> The bird wasn't quickly eaten by the cat.</p>
<h2>Imperative and Jussive Moods</h2>
<p>In Globasa, commands (<em>imperative mood</em>) and exhortation (<em>jussive mood</em>) are both expressed using the
	particle <strong>am</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The particle <strong>am</strong> is truncated from <strong>amiru</strong> (command)<br> Etymology of
		<strong>amiru</strong>: Arabic (أمر “amr”), Turkish (emir), Swahili (amri, -amuru)</em></p>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Imperative Mood</h3>
<p>The pronouns <strong>yu</strong> and <strong>uyu</strong> may be omitted when expressing the <em>imperative
		mood</em>.</p>
<h3>Jussive Mood</h3>
<p>The <em>jussive mood</em> is similar in meaning to the <em>imperative mood</em> but is used for the 3rd person
	(<strong>te</strong>/<strong>to</strong>, <strong>ete</strong>/<strong>oto</strong>), as well as the 1st person
	singular (<strong>mi</strong>).</p>
<p>The jussive mood can also function as a <em>mandative subjunctive</em> within subordinate clauses. The <em>mandative
		subjunctive</em> expresses a demand, requirement, request, recommendation or suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Mi vole ki te am safegi sesu kamer.</strong><br> I want him to clean his room.</p>
<p><strong>Mi peti ki imi am xorata jaldi.</strong><br> I ask that we arrive early.</p>
<p><strong>Kitabu hu xwexiyen am doxo da no sen daymo lungo.</strong><br> The book that the pupils are to read is not
	very long.</p>
<h2>Negation</h2>
<p>Negation for all verbs forms is expressed with the word <strong>no</strong> and, as an adverb, it immediately
	precedes the verb and any other modifying adverbs.</p>
<table>

				doesn't eat the apple.<br><br><strong>Am no yam pingo.</strong><br>Don't eat the apple.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<h2>Infinitive Mood</h2>
<p>In Globasa, the infinitive verb form is marked with the particle <strong>na</strong> and is typically omitted within
	a clause once it has been established with the first verb. See <a
		href="./jumleli-estrutur.html#nafalelexili_jumlemon">Infinitive Verb Phrases</a> under Sentence Structure.
</p>
<p><em>Etymology of <strong>na</strong>: Greek (να “na”), Hindi (-ना “-na”)</em></p>
<h2>Subordinate Clauses</h2>
<p>As seen above, <em>if</em> clauses in conditional sentences use the dictionary verb form. However, not every sentence
	that has an <em>if</em> clause is a conditional sentence. Unless the sentence is conditional, <em>if</em> clauses
	are marked for tense. </p>
<p><strong>Eger mi xa yam pingo, mi xa no haji sen yamkal.</strong><br> If I eat the apple (<em>in the future</em>), I
	will no longer be hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Eger te le yam yusu pingo, kam yu xa sen gadibu?</strong><br> If he ate your apple (<em>in the past</em>),
	will you be angry?</p>
<p><strong>Eger te yam yusu pingo, kam yu gadibucu?</strong><br> If he eats your apples (<em>in general</em>), do you
	get angry?</p>
<h3>Sentences with other subordinate clauses</h3>
<p>Besides <strong>eger</strong> (<em>if</em>), subordinate clauses may begin with other conjunctions, such as
	<strong>denwatu hu</strong> (<em>when</em>), <strong>denloka hu</strong> (<em>where</em>), <strong>koski</strong>
	(<em>because</em>), etc. Tense markers are obligatory in all these subordinate clauses.</p>
<p></p>
