<h1>Word Order: Phrase Structure</h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Strict Word Order</h2>
<p>In Globasa, a relatively strict word order is applied within phrases.</p>
<h2>Noun Phrases <a id="namelexili_jumlemon"></a></h2>
<p>Noun phrases consist of the following structure, as illustrated in the table below:</p>
<p>(Specifier) + (Complement) + Head</p>
<table style="width:100%">

			<td colspan="6"><b>Noun Phrase</b></td>

</table>
<p>Since specifiers and complements are optional, a noun phrase may consist of a single noun, for example,
	<strong>kitabu</strong>.</p>
<h3>Third-Person Pronouns at End of Noun Phrases <a id="pornamelexi_in_namelexili_jumlemon"></a></h3>
<p>Noun phrases must always end in either a noun or a pronoun. Whenever a noun is understood and omitted, a pronoun must
	replace it, rather than leaving a specifier or complement hanging. Without the use of pronouns to complete noun
	phrases, such phrases would have different meanings or create incomplete and therefore ungrammatical sentences.</p>
<h3>Determiner + Pronoun = Complete Noun Phrase</h3>
<p><strong><em>Banete</em> ergo velosi ji <em>banete</em> ergo hanman.</strong><br />
	<em>Some</em> work quickly and <em>some</em> work slowly.
</p>
<p>Without the pronoun <strong>te</strong>, the sentence would read:<br />
	<strong>Ban ergo sen velosi ji ban ergo sen hanman.</strong><br /> Some work is fast and some work is slow.
</p>
<h3>Possessive Adj + Pronoun (Possessive Pronoun) = Complete Noun Phrase</h3>
<p><strong>Yusu gami ergo velosi mas <em>misu</em> te ergo hanman.</strong><br /> Your spouse works fast but
	<em>mine</em> works slow.</p>
<p>Without the pronoun <strong>te</strong>, the second part of the sentence would read:<br />
	<strong>Misu ergo sen hanman.</strong><br /> My work/job is slow.
</p>
<h3>Quantifier + Pronoun = Complete Noun Phrase</h3>
<p><strong>Dua basataytiyen ergo velosi mas <em>un te</em> ergo hanman.</strong><br /> Two translators work quickly but
	<em>one</em> works slowly.</p>
<p>Without the pronoun <strong>te</strong>, the second part of the sentence would read:<br />
	<strong>Un ergo sen hanman.</strong><br /> One job is slow.
</p>
<h3>Adjective + Pronoun = Complete Noun Phrase</h3>
<p><strong>Day manyen ergo velosi mas <em>lil te</em> ergo hanman.</strong><br /> The big man works quickly but the
	<em>small one</em> works slowly.</p>
<p>Without the pronoun <strong>te</strong>, the second part of the sentence would read:<br />
	<strong>Lil ergo sen hanman.</strong><br /> The small job is slow.
</p>
<h2>Verb Phrases</h2>
<p>Verb phrases are similar in structure to noun phrases:</p>

<h3>Verb Markers</h3>
<p>As specifiers, verb markers (<strong>nun</strong>, <strong>le</strong>, <strong>xa</strong>, <strong>ger</strong>,
	<strong>am</strong>, <strong>na</strong>) are placed at the start of verb phrases.</p>
<h3>Adverbs</h3>
<p>As seen in the sentence above, adverbs (or adverb phrases) typically precede verbs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, adverbs may be placed after the verb, immediately following objects, if any.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the sentence has no direct or indirect objects the adverb may immediately follow the verb.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Femyen danse <em>meli</em>.</strong><br /> The lady dance <em>beautifully</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>However, if the sentence contains objects, the adverb phrase must immediately follow all objects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mi le gibe pesa cel coriyen <em>volekal</em> koski mi le befobi ki te xa morgi mi.</strong><br /> I gave the
	money to the thief <em>involuntarily</em> because I feared he would kill me.</p>
<p>Adverbs may also be moved to the start of the sentence, so long as there is a definite pause with the comma to
	separate the phrase from the rest of the sentence. Without the pause, the adjective/adverb could be mistakenly
	interpreted as modifying the subject.</p>
<p><strong><em>Velosi</em>, bwaw glu sui.</strong><br />
	<em>Quickly</em>, the dog drinks the water.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Unyum</em>, te le idi cel banko.</strong><br />
	<em>First</em>, she went to the bank.
</p>
<h2>Negation</h2>
<p>The negating adverb <strong>no</strong> immediately precedes the word or phrase being negated.</p>
<p><strong>Manyen <em>no godomo bur</em> danse.</strong><br /> or: <strong>Manyen danse <em>no godomo
			bur</em>.</strong><br /> The man <em>doesn't</em> dance <em>too badly</em>.</p>
<p>In the second sentence above, <strong>no</strong> is along with the rest of the complement to the end of the
	sentence. (The man did dance, but not too badly.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>no</strong> could immediately precede the verb and interpreted as modifying the verb plus its
	descriptive adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Manixu <em>no danse godomo bur</em>.</strong><br /> The man <em>doesn't dance too badly</em>.</p>
<h2>Infinitive Verb Phrases</h2>
<p>Infinitive verb phrases have the following structure:</p>
<p><strong>na</strong> + verb phrase</p>
<p>See <a href="./jumleli-estrutur.html#nafalelexili_jumlemon">Infinitive Verb Phrases</a> under Sentence Structure.</p>
<h2>Prepositional Phrases</h2>
<p>Globasa, like most SVO languages, uses prepositions rather than <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition">postpositions</a>. Prepositional phrases are
	composed of a preposition followed by a noun phrase.</p>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2"><b>Prepositional Phrase</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Preposition</th>
			<th>Noun Phrase</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>in </b><br />in</td>
			<td><b>day sanduku</b><br />large box</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" style="font-size:125%;"><b>in day sanduku</b><br />in the large box</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>The position of prepositional phrases within sentences is explained under <a
		href="./jumleli-estrutur.html#plasilexili_jumlemon">Sentence Structure</a>.</p>
<h2>Adverbs of Focus</h2>
<p>Other than <strong>no</strong> (<em>not</em>), <em>Adverbs of focus</em>, such as <strong>sol</strong>
	(<em>only</em>), <strong>pia</strong> (<em>also</em>, <em>too</em>) and <strong>hata</strong> (<em>even</em>), do
	not appear in the Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase tables above. The reason for this is that <em>adverbs of focus</em>
	can appear anywhere in a sentence, depending on what is being modified in the sentence. <em>Adverbs of focus</em>
	always immediately precede the phrase or word they modify.</p>
<p><strong>Misu gami glu <em>sol</em> kafe fe soba.</strong><br /> My spouse drinks <em>only</em> coffee in the morning.
</p>
<p><strong>Misu gami glu kafe <em>hata</em> fe axam.</strong><br /> My spouse drinks coffee <em>even</em> in the
	evening. </p>
<p><strong><em>Pia</em> misu gami glu kafe fe soba.</strong><br /> My spouse, <em>too</em>, drinks coffee in the
	morning. </p>
<h2>Complex Adjective Phrases</h2>
<p>Complex adjective phrases come after the nouns they modify.</p>
<p><strong>Adj/Adv&nbsp;plus&nbsp;Prepositional Phrase</strong></p>
<p><strong>kitabu eskrido fal misu doste</strong><br /> the book written by my friend</p>
<p><strong>alimyen hox kos&nbsp;yusu sukses</strong><br /> the teacher happy for your success</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Adj/Adv Phrases</strong></p>
<p><strong>nini maxmo&nbsp;lao kom misu sodar</strong><br /> the kid older than my brother</p>
<h2>Relative Clauses <a id="relativo_baxjumle"></a></h2>
<p>In Globasa, relative clauses are introduced with the <em>modifying clause marker</em> <strong>hu</strong> and retain
	typical word order. It is worth noting that the conjunction <strong>hu</strong> doesn't have an exact equivalent in
	English but is typically translated as <em>who</em>, <em>which</em>, or <em>that</em>. </p>
<h3>Relative Clauses with Resumptive Pronoun</h3>
<p>Relative clauses that require a pronoun to refer back to the antecedent use the <em>obligatory</em> resumptive
	relative pronoun <strong>da</strong> (<em>he, she, it, they, that, that one, those, those ones</em>). </p>
<p><strong>Te sen femixu <em>hu da lubi mi</em>.</strong><br /> "She is the woman <em>who that-one loves me</em>."<br />
	She is the woman <em>who loves me</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Te sen femixu <em>hu mi lubi da</em>.</strong><br /> "She is the woman <em>who I love that-one</em>."<br />
	She is the woman <em>whom I love</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mi le sonxi katatul <em>hu mi kata roti yon da</em>.</strong><br /> "I lost the knife <em>which I cut the
		bread with that-one</em>."<br /> I lost the knife <em>with which I cut the bread</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Kamisa <em>hu mi suki da</em> sen blue.</strong> or <strong>To sen blue, kamisa <em>hu mi suki
			da</em>.</strong><br /> "The shirt <em>which I like that-one</em> is blue." or "It's blue, the shirt
	<em>which I like that-one</em>."<br /> The shirt <em>(that) I like</em> is blue. <em>or</em> It's blue, the shirt
	<em>(that) I like</em>. </p>
<p><em>Note: As seen in the last example, when the relative clause is part of the subject, the sentence may be reworded
		in order to place the core of the sentence first and move the relative clause to the end of the sentence. This
		helps to make the sentence easier to process.</em></p>
<p>The possessive adjective <strong>dasu</strong> is used in relative clauses as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Te sen manixu <em>hu dasu sodar kone mi</em>.</strong><br /> "He is the man <em>who his brother knows
		me.</em>"<br /> He is the man <em>whose brother knows me</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Te sen manixu <em>hu mi kone dasu sodar</em>.</strong><br /> "He is the man <em>who I know his
		brother</em>."<br /> He is the man <em>whose brother I know</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Manyen <em>hu dasu gami Globasa</em> sen misu doste.</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>Te sen misu doste, manyen
		<em>hu dasu gami Globasa</em>.</strong><br /> "The guy <em>who that-one's spouse speaks Globasa</em> is my
	friend." <em>or</em> "He's my friend, the guy <em>who that one's spouse speaks Globasa</em>."<br /> The guy
	<em>whose spouse speaks Globasa</em> is my friend. <em>or</em> He is my friend, the guy <em>whose spouse speaks
		Globasa</em>.</p>
<h3>Relative Clauses with Resumptive Correlative Adverb</h3>
<p>Relative clauses in which a correlative adverb refers back to the antecedent are as follows: </p>
<p><strong>Kitabudom <em>hu mi ergo denloka</em> sen day.</strong><br /> "The library <em>which I work there</em> is
	big."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Kitabudom <em>hu denloka mi ergo</em> sen day.</strong><br /> "The library <em>which there I work</em> is
	big."<br /> The library <em>where I work</em> is big.
</p>
<p><strong>Din <em>hu mi xa preata denwatu</em> sen Lunadin.</strong><br /> "The day <em>which I arrive then</em> is
	Monday."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Din <em>hu denwatu mi xa preata</em> sen Lunadin.</strong><br /> "The day <em>which then I arrive</em> is
	Monday."<br /> The day <em>when I arrive</em> is Monday.
</p>
<p>Instead of correlative adverbs, prepositional phrases may be used to convey equivalent sentences. </p>
<p><strong>Kitabudom <em>hu mi ergo in da</em> sen day.</strong><br /> "The library <em>which I work in it</em> is
	big."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Kitabudom <em>hu in da mi ergo</em> sen day.</strong><br /> "The library <em>which in it I work</em> is
	big."<br /> The library <em>in which I work</em> is big.
</p>
<p><strong>Din <em>hu mi xa preata fe da</em> sen Lunadin.</strong><br /> "The day <em>which I arrive on it</em> is
	Monday."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Din <em>hu fe da mi xa preata</em> sen Lunadin.</strong><br /> "The day <em>which on it I arrive</em> is
	Monday."<br /> The day <em>on which I arrive</em> is Monday.
</p>
<h3>Relative Clauses in Non-Specific Noun Phrases</h3>
<p>Non-specific noun phrases with relative clauses may be composed of <strong>to/te</strong> plus a resumptive
	correlative adverb or <strong>da</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Mi no suki <em>to hu mi ergo denloka</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>it which I work
		there</em>."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Mi no suki <em>to hu denloka mi ergo</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>it which there I
		work</em>."<br /> I don't like <em>where I work</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Mi suki <em>to hu yu broxa misu tofa denmaner</em>.</strong><br /> "I like <em>it which you brush my hair
		that way</em>."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Mi suki <em>to hu denmaner yu broxa misu tofa</em>.</strong><br /> "I like <em>it which that way you brush
		my hair</em>."<br /> I like <em>how you brush my hair</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Am gibe tas mi <em>to hu mi vole da</em>.</strong><br /> "Give me <em>it which I want that</em>."<br /> Give
	me <em>what I want</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Mi no suki <em>te hu yu le seleti da</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>her/him/them who you chose
		that-one.</em>"<br /> I don't like <em>whom you chose</em>. </p>
<p>Alternatively, they may be composed of a noun plus a resumptive prepositional phrase or <strong>da</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Mi no suki <em>loka hu mi ergo in da</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>the place which I work in
		that</em>."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Mi no suki <em>loka hu in da mi ergo</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>the place which in that I
		work</em>."<br /> I don't like <em>the place in which I work</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Mi suki <em>maner hu yu broxa misu tofa yon da</em>.</strong><br /> "I like <em>the way which you brush my
		hair in that</em>."<br />
	<em>or</em><br />
	<strong>Mi suki <em>maner hu yon da yu broxa misu tofa</em>.</strong><br /> "I like <em>the way which in that you
		brush my hair</em>."<br /> I like <em>the way in which you brush my hair</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>Am gibe tas mi <em>xey hu mi vole da</em>.</strong><br /> "Give me <em>the thing which I want
		that</em>."<br /> Give me <em>the thing (that) I want</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Mi no suki <em>person hu yu le seleti da</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>the person who you chose
		that-one.</em>"<br /> I don't like <em>the person you chose</em>.</p>
<h2>Non-relative Modifying Clauses</h2>
<p>Nouns are sometimes modified with clauses that are not relative, in other words, clauses without a resumptive
	element. These clauses are introduced using <strong>feki</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Singa begude idey <em>feki maux ger abil na sahay te</em>.</strong><br /> The lion was tickled by the idea
	<em>that the mouse could help him</em>.</p>
<h2>Clauses with <em>feki</em> instead of Relative Clauses with <em>hu</em></h2>
<p>Noun phrases with words of place, time, manner and reason may be modified using clauses with <strong>feki</strong>
	instead of relative clauses with <strong>hu</strong>. In other words, in order to create shorter sentences without
	resumptive clauses, <strong>feki</strong> may replace <strong>hu</strong> plus a resumptive correlative or
	prepositional phrase (<strong>hu denloka/hu in da</strong>, <strong>hu denwatu/hu fe da</strong>, <strong>hu
		denmaner/hu yon da</strong>, <strong>hu denseba/hu kos da</strong>). </p>
<p><strong>Mi no suki <em>restoran feki imi le yam</em>.</strong><br /> "I don't like <em>the restaurant that we ate
		at</em>."<br /> I don't like <em>the restaurant we ate at</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Te sokutu <em>(fe) moy mara feki te estaycu</em>.</strong><br /> "He falls every time that he stands
	up."<br /> He falls every time he stands up. </p>
<p><strong>Mi suki <em>maner feki yu broxa misu tofa</em>.</strong><br /> "I like <em>the way that you brush my
		hair</em>."<br /> I like <em>the way you brush my hair</em>. </p>
<p><strong><em>Seba feki yu no xwexi</em> sen koski yu no abyasa.</strong><br /> "The reason that you don't learn is
	because you don't practice."<br /> The reason you don't learn is because you don't practice. </p>
<p></p>
